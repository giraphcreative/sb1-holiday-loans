			<h3 class="text-center">Simply tell us how many gifts you plan to give this year, and we'll show you a plan to pay for it!</h3>
			<p>Did you know that the average holiday shopper spends more than $861 on gifts, décor, greeting cards, and more? Many of us start the new year strapped for cash or in debt and wonder how we’re going to pay it all off.</p>
			<p>It’s easy to reach for the credit card to pay for it all. But, we have a better solution – a holiday loan from your credit union! With automatic payments, you can pay your holiday bills over the next year – making for an easy, stress-free holiday season!</p>
			<p>Best of all, you may borrow up to $2,500 at 5.99%APR!* Want to see how much you can save? Check out our holiday gift calculator.
